This was my capstone project at General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersive, being the original goal building one hybrid recommender system.

I knew building a recommender system was going to be a big challenge, but that only made it more interesting and rewarding. It was going to be challenging because it was something new (I started the project before having the recommender systems lesson) and the opportunities are pretty much endless (specially for the hybrid systems), so I had a to do a lot of reading, research and thinking to get different ideas for the systems. Finally, I managed to get a set of 5 systems between collaborative-filtering, content-based and hybrid models.

First, I started with some data cleaning, feature engineering and EDA. Then I built the first recommender system: a collaborative-filtering model. Moving onto the content-based models, I built two versions, being the second an improvement of the first one. Finally, I built two hybrid models. The Jupyter Notebook includes a step by step description of the project.

The data used for this project can be found online at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ in the section "recommended for education and development" as the "full" dataset.

A more detailed explanation of my next steps is included in the Jupyter Notebook, but in few words, they are the following:
-	Improving the models by including more features (feature engineering)
-	Building other hybrid recommender systems
-	Using neural networks to try to improve the models
-	Building a user-friendly Flask App/Web
